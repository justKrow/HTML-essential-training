    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I started my web development career in 2006 and have worked with many different brands at top digital agencies. Along the way, I began teaching workshops, college courses, and bootcamp classes. These days, I work independently, focusing mainly on creating online content. To learn more about my work history, check out my LinkedIn profile. If you're curious about a career in web development or looking for a refresher, check out my LinkedIn Learning courses or my YouTube HTML & CSS series, Decoded by Christina. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <p>Here's a quote from one of my favorite singers:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/t-magazine/rihanna-miranda-july-interview.html">
      <p>I used to feel unsafe right in the moment of an accomplishment — I felt the ground fall from under my feet because this could be the end. And even now, while everyone is celebrating, I’m on to the next thing. I don’t want to get lost in this big cushion of success.</p>
